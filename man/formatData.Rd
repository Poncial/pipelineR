\title{This function takes a list of data frames or tibbles (assumed to be in
\code{yahooDt}), and pivots each element from wide to long format. All columns
except the first two are gathered into a key column named \code{metric} and a
value column named \code{value}.}
\usage{
formatData()
}
\value{
A list of tibbles or data frames, each in long format with columns:
\itemize{
\item the original first two columns,
\item \code{metric} (formerly column names from the wide data),
\item \code{value} (corresponding cell values).
}
}
\description{
This function takes a list of data frames or tibbles (assumed to be in
\code{yahooDt}), and pivots each element from wide to long format. All columns
except the first two are gathered into a key column named \code{metric} and a
value column named \code{value}.
}
\details{
It relies on \code{purrr::map()} to iterate over the list, and
\code{tidyr::pivot_longer()} to reshape each table. If your input object is
named differently, you should assign it to \code{yahooDt} before calling this
function, or modify the function signature accordingly.
